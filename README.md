# machine learning scikit-learn scripts
# deep learning tensorflow scripts

This repo contains some machine learning and deep learning python code created for study and research projects from
Aurélien Géron - Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (2017, O’Reilly Media)

There is a line by line review, complication, and application of every line of code in github.com/kayfay/handson-ml
